DocSpring can automatically generate web-based forms based on the fields you've set up in your template. If you send your users a link to this form, they can fill out the form to generate a PDF. You can then redirect users to a different page after they have filled out the form.

You can also [embed our web-based forms on your own website](/docs/guides/embedded-forms/embedded-web-forms/). Our embedded form library can be configured with JavaScript options and callbacks.

<Aside type="note">
  This feature was originally named "Simple Forms". We have started calling it
  "Web Forms" to differentiate it from "Visual Forms".
</Aside>

## Configure Template Privacy Settings

First, you will need to go to your template's settings and make sure that "Online Form Privacy"
is set to "Public". This will allow unauthenticated users to fill out your embedded form.

You may also want to set "Submission Privacy" to "Public".
When this is set to "Private", the user can save the form, but they will not be able to see when the PDF has been processed. They will also not be able to download the generated PDF.

When "Submission Privacy" is set to "Public", the user can wait until the PDF has been processed, and you can show them a link to download the PDF.

## Query Params

You can set some query params in the URL to provide default data, set submission metadata, or hide some fields on the form.

### Set Default Data

- `?data[field]=<value>`
- `?data[nested][field]=<value>`
- `?data[array][][field]=<value>`

Use the following syntax to set default data for nested fields inside objects or arrays:

| Field Name                          | Query Param                                          |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                              | `data[name]=John`                                    |
| `person/name`                       | `data[person][name]=John`                            |
| `person/0/name`                     | `data[person][][name]=John`                          |
| `person/0/name` and `person/1/name` | `data[person][][name]=John&data[person][][name]=Bob` |

**Example:** Set default values for the name and email fields.

```
https://app.docspring.com/templates/tpl_1234567890abcdef01/form?data[name]=John%20Smith&data[email]=test@example.com
```

### Set Submission Metadata

<Aside type="note">
  Submission metadata is included in API responses and webhook notifications,
  but is not included in the generated PDF.
</Aside>

`?metadata[<key>]=<value>`

**Example:** Set an internal `userId` value in the submission metadata:

```
https://app.docspring.com/templates/tpl_1234567890abcdef01/form?metadata[userId]=123
```

**Example:** Change the PDF filename by setting `pdf_filename` in the submission metadata:

```
https://app.docspring.com/templates/tpl_1234567890abcdef01/form?metadata[pdf_filename]=MyGeneratedPDF_123
```

<Aside type="tip">
  When the user downloads the PDF, the filename will be MyGeneratedPDF_123.pdf
</Aside>

### Hidden Fields

You can also hide some fields on the form by passing `hidden_fields` as a list of comma-separated field names.

`?hidden_fields=<field_1>,<field_2>,...`

**Example:** Set a default value for the `name` field, and hide the field:

```
https://app.docspring.com/templates/tpl_1234567890abcdef01/form?data[name]=John%20Smith&hidden_fields=name
```

**Example:** Set a default value for the `person/0/name` field, and hide the field.

_(You don't need to use any special syntax for nested fields in `hidden_fields`. You can refer to the original field name, as shown in the template editor.)_

```
https://app.docspring.com/templates/tpl_1234567890abcdef01/form?data[person][][name]=John%20Smith&hidden_fields=person/0/name
```

<Aside type="caution">
  If you hide a required field without passing a default value, you will get a
  validation error and you will not be able to generate a PDF.
</Aside>

## Redirect to a URL

After the user submits the form, you can redirect them to a different URL.
The redirect URL can be configured [in the template settings](/docs/template-editor/settings/#redirect-url).

The submission ID, template ID, and template name will be appended to this URL as query params:
`https://example.com/?submission_id=sub_123&template_id=tpl_123&template_name=My%20Template`

When "Submission Privacy" is set to **"Private"**, the user will be redirected as soon
as the form has been saved. When "Submission Privacy" is set to **"Public"**, the user will be redirected after the PDF has finished processing.

## Custom Logo

You can display a custom logo at the top of hosted web forms.

[Visit the Account page](https://app.docspring.com/account), click the "Choose File" button under "Logo for Web Forms", then select an image file. You should upload an SVG image, or a JPG, PNG, or WEBP image with a width of at least 400px. The max file size is 5 MB. For best results, your image should be a horizontal rectangle:

<Image
  src={exampleLogo}
  alt="Example logo"
  width={300}
  style="margin: 14px 0 5px; padding: 10px 17px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"
/>

Click "Save" to upload your image. When you visit a template form, you should now see your logo at the top of the page:

<Image
  src={formWithCustomLogo}
  alt="Form with custom logo"
  style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: 20px 0;"
/>

<Aside type="note">
  Logos are not shown for embedded forms on your own website. However, you have
  full control of the page, so you can manually add a logo or any other content.
</Aside>
