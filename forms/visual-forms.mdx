Visual Forms allow you to embed a PDF form filling interface directly on your website. Unlike [Data Requests](/docs/forms/data-requests/), visual forms do not include compliance features like audit trails or authentication tracking - they're simply a visual component for filling out PDF templates.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use Visual Forms when you need a simple form filling interface. Use Data
  Requests when you need legally binding electronic signatures with UETA/ESIGN
  compliance.
</Aside>

## How Visual Forms Work

1. Share a linke to the visual form page for a template `/templates/<template_id>/visual_form`
2. **Users fill out the form** with a visual interface that matches your PDF
3. **PDF is generated** and available for download

## Key Features

- Real-time preview of the PDF as users fill it out
- Field validation and formatting
- Support for all DocSpring field types
- Mobile-responsive design
- No user accounts needed
- Perfect for internal forms or non-legal documents

## Template Configuration

Visual forms work with any PDF template. Key settings to consider:

### Submission Privacy

- **Public**: PDFs can be downloaded immediately after generation
- **Private**: Requires authentication to download the generated PDF

### Redirect URL

Configure where users go after form submission:

1. Set in template settings as default
2. Override with `redirectURL` option in the query params
