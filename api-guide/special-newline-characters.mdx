## The `%%LF%%` Sequence

If you are integrating with a service that makes it difficult to send literal [newline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline) characters (`\n`) in the submission data, you can use this special sequence of characters: `%%LF%%`

DocSpring will automatically replace any instances of `%%LF%%` with a newline character (`\n`) in the submission data.

<Aside type="note">
  You will still see `%%LF%%` if you view the "Data" tab for a Submission or in
  the API Request Logs. We will make the `%%LF%%` â†’ `\n` substitution
  immediately before inserting the data into your PDF template.

## Example

If your integration sends:

```json
{
  "address": "123 Main Street%%LF%%Suite 100%%LF%%New York, NY 10001"
}
```

DocSpring will render it in the PDF as:

```
123 Main Street
Suite 100
New York, NY 10001
```
