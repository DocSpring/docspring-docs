When generating PDFs through the DocSpring API, you can customize both the PDF title (shown in PDF reader applications) and the filename in the download URL.

## Customize the PDF Title

You can customize the PDF title by setting the `pdf_title` key in the submission metadata.

For example, if you set `pdf_title` to `Custom PDF Title`, then PDF reader applications will display this title.

<Aside type="note">
  By default, the PDF title is set to the name of the template.

## Customize the PDF Filename in the Download URL

You can customize the PDF filename by setting the `pdf_filename` key in the submission metadata. DocSpring will add the `.pdf` extension automatically.

For example, if you set `pdf_filename` to `custom_pdf_file123`, the PDF URL will end with: `/submissions/<submission_id>/custom_pdf_file123.pdf`

<Aside type="note">
  By default, the PDF URL will end with `/submissions/<submission_id>.pdf`

<Aside type="tip">
  Custom PDF filenames have a maximum length of 128 characters, and can include
  the following characters: `0-9 A-Z a-z - _ .`. Any other characters will be
  replaced with an underscore.
