If the full text can't fit in a field and the field's "Overflow" option is set to "Truncate",
DocSpring will store any truncated text in the submission.
This will be returned as a `truncated_text` object when you make a **Get Submission** API request.

### Response Format

<Code
  code={`{
    "submission": {
      // ... other submission data ...
      "truncated_text": {
        "title": ["text that could not fit in the field"]
      }
      // ... other submission data ...
    }
  }`}
  lang="json"
  title="Example submission response with truncated text"
/>

Every key in the `truncated_text` object is a field name, and each value is an array of strings.

<Aside type="note">
  Most of the time this will be an array with a single string. However, if a
  template contains multiple fields that share the same name (e.g. rendering the
  same text in multiple places on the PDF), then the array may contain multiple
  truncated strings from each individual field.

## Use Case: Addendum Pages

Some government and immigration forms have an optional addendum page that can be attached if any text is too long to fit in one of the fields.

You could:

1. Check the `truncated_text` for each submission
2. Set up another template to generate any addendum pages when necessary
3. Use the Combine PDFs API endpoint to merge the main PDF form and any addendum pages

This approach ensures all submitted information is captured, even when form fields have size limitations.
