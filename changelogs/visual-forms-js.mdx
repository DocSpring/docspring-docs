This client-side JavaScript library allows you to embed a visual form on your own website
to fill out PDF templates and generate PDFs.

<Aside type="caution">
  The visual forms library does not provide any ESIGN/UETA compliance features
  such as audit trail logging. It is used internally by the [Data
  Requests](/docs/guides/embedded-forms/embedded-data-requests/) library when we
  display the signing form inside a secure iframe. Please use the data requests
  library if you need to collect legally binding signatures.
