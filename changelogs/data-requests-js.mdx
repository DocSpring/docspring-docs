### Why haven't we updated this library recently?

The Data Requests library is a short piece of code that inserts our secure signing iframe into a webpage
and provides a JavaScript API to interact with the iframe, so it doesn't need to be updated very often.
The signing experience inside the iframe uses our [Visual Forms library](/docs/forms/js-libraries/visual-forms-js/).
