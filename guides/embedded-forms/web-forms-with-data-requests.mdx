You can use a web form to gather information with text inputs,
then create a data request that is prefilled with the data from the web form.
The data request will show a preview of the PDF with the filled-in data before asking
the user to sign the form.

In this example, we use the simple embedded forms to show a form, but we hide the signature field in the `processTemplateSchema` callback by removing it from the template schema. We also cancel the PDF submission by returning `false` in the `onSubmit` callback. When the simple form is submitted, we send the data to our server, which makes an API call to create a prefilled data request.

<Aside type="caution">
  You must always use a data request if you are collecting legally binding
  electronic signatures. If you only use a simple form with a signature field,
  the user could be signing a document that they haven't seen. DocSpring will
  also not be able to store any information about how the user was
  authenticated, so these signatures will not be legally binding.
</Aside>

For the initial data collection step, you could use any form library that supports JSON schemas, such as [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form).
