Welcome to the DocSpring Guides section! Here you'll find detailed tutorials and step-by-step instructions for implementing various DocSpring features.

## Embedded Form Guides

Learn how to integrate DocSpring forms into your own website or application:

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Embedded Web Forms"
    href="/docs/guides/embedded-forms/embedded-web-forms/"
    description="Add web forms to your site for collecting user data and generating PDFs"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Embedded Visual Forms"
    href="/docs/guides/embedded-forms/embedded-visual-forms/"
    description="Embed visual PDF forms that users can fill out directly on your page"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Embedded Data Requests"
    href="/docs/guides/embedded-forms/embedded-data-requests/"
    description="Implement legally binding electronic signatures with UETA/ESIGN compliance"
  />
</CardGrid>

## What's the Difference?

- **Web Forms**: Simple forms for collecting data, with basic fields and validation
- **Visual Forms**: Show a visual representation of the PDF as users fill it out
- **Data Requests**: Include audit trails and authentication for legal compliance
