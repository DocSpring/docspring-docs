## Getting Started

- You can upload PDF templates and configure form fields in our [template editor](/docs/template-editor/introduction/).
- You can also create a template using [HTML and CSS](/docs/html-templates/overview/).

You can generate PDFs by [posting data to our API](/docs/api/#tag/pdf-submissions/post/templates/{template_id}/submissions), or filling out an online form. We can [automatically generate web forms](/docs/forms/web-forms/) from the fields in your template. You can also [embed these web forms on your own website](/docs/guides/embedded-forms/embedded-web-forms/), and your users can fill out the form to generate a PDF.

## Synchronous API

The DocSpring API supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

- Requests to `sync.api.docspring.com` are **synchronous** by default. _(We wait for the PDF to be processed before returning a response.)_
  - _Use `sync.api-eu.docspring.com` for the EU region._
- Requests to `api.docspring.com` are **asynchronous** by default. _(Pending PDF is returned immediately.)_
  - _Use `api-eu.docspring.com` for the EU region._

## E-signatures

You can collect legally binding electronic signatures by creating [Data Requests](/docs/forms/data-requests/). Your users can visit a signing form hosted on [docspring.com](https://docspring.com), or you can embed the signing form on your own website.

## API Reference

Our API documentation has examples for JavaScript, Ruby, Python, PHP, C# (.Net), and Bash (curl). More client libraries and examples are coming soon. Please [contact us](mailto:support@docspring.com) to request a client library for a different programming language.
